Reporting Bugs or Feature Requests
==================================
Please report all issues/bugs/requests to [Issues page](https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/issues). Describe the problem you are having, and include steps taken to cause the issue to occur.

If you report a bug, you must provide the application debug log. You need to run RSS Guard from command line and redirect its regular/error program output to a file.

After starting RSS Guard that way, reproduce your issue and attach the log file to your ticket.

```{attention}
Application log can also be displayed directly in RSS Guard (the `Help > Display application log` menu item). Note that the log messages are pumped into dialog window only when it is opened (the window can be minimized). Also note that this window might have negative impact on RSS Guard performance.
```

For broader questions and general ideas, use the [Discussions page](https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/discussions).
