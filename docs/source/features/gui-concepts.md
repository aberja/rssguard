When you start RSS Guard for the very first time, you are greeted with `Add account` dialog where you select which account you want to operate with. If you want to have classic `RSS/ATOM` feed reader, then select `RSS/RDF/ATOM/JSON` option.

Each "account" offers account-specific actions which are accessible in relevant submenu.

To add new feed into the account you simply use `Feeds -> Add item -> Add a new feed` menu item. You do not need to know direct URL address of your feed file, it is enough to enter just the URL of the website you are interested in, for example `https://www.hltv.org`, and RSS Guard will find all available feed sources.

You can also switch to more advanced dialog for adding individual feeds.

In 99% of cases, you only need to insert feed URL into `Source` field and then hit `Fetch it now` button which will download feed metadata and fill all other boxes.
