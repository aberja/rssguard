RSS Guard 5 versus RSS Guard 4
==============================
Over the time of RSS Guard existence, it got many many features and got rather bloated. This is not quite what I as RSS Guard author had in mind when starting RSS Guard.

RSS Guard was meant to be simple feed reader with quite good speed while also provide next-gen features for power users like scriptable filtering.

Therefore new RSS Guard major version 5 returns the application to its core ideas. Many features found in version 4 are not present in version 5, like web browsing abilities, AdBlock, embedded file downloader etc. This makes codebase much slimmer and much more maintainable.

As for data compatibility, version 5 is fully compatible with version 4, meaning if your have RSS Guard 4 installed, you can simply take your user data and copy it into RSS Guard 5 and it will all work. The opposite direction, using RSS Guard 5 data with RSS Guard 4, is **not possible**.
